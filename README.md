# DailyStockRegister
This project was started with the aim to facilitate maintain an excel based stock register for Shubham Gas Service. People an not proficient with any techinical knowlege. They print every excel sheet and put it in a file to maintain history. My aim with this project is to help them keep a digital copy of what they do and avoid any print outs.

So ideally this is done to facilitate a versioning system for excel.
